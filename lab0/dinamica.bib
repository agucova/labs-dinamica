	abstract = {This study assessed reliability of split times obtained by handheld stopwatches ({HHSs}) compared with electronic timing ({ET}) during a 200-m sprint. Two {HHS} timing methods were compared with {ET}: single-split timers ({SST}) and multiple-split timers ({MST}). Twenty-six timers without previous experience were given instruction and completed practice trials until good agreement was achieved between {ET} and {HHS}. Trained runners (8 males, 10 females) were timed for each 25-m interval on a standard 200-m course. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation models were used to determine reliability. A total of 248 split times were analyzed. No significant differences were found between the three timing methods (p {\textgreater} 0.99), and calculated intraclass correlation values were high (0.988). Mean error between {SST}, {MST}, and {ET} (-0.04 +/- 0.24 and -0.05 +/- 0.24 seconds, respectively) indicated faster {HHS} times, though not significantly. However, absolute errors were considerably larger (0.15 +/- 0.20 and 0.16 +/- 0.19 between {SST}, {MST}, and {ET}, respectively). The {HHS}-recorded splits were faster than {ET} in 67.3\% of splits and slower in 29.4\%. The distribution of errors made the development of a reliable correction factor to convert {HHS} to {ET} impossible. It was concluded that on the basis of the small mean error and high intraclass correlations, the use of {HHSs} may be a viable alternative to {ET} in collecting group data. However, on the basis of the absolute error between {HHS} and {ET}, when high degrees of precision are required, {ET} should be used, and reliable correction of {HHS} to {ET} values is not possible. It was further concluded that {HHS} times should be reported without attempting correction and interpreted in light of the shortcomings of the {HHS} method.},

	abstract = {The need for error analysis is captured in the book's arresting cover shot - of the 1895 Paris train disaster (also available as a wall poster). The early chapters teach elementary techniques of error propagation and statistical analysis to enable students to produce successful lab reports. Later chapters treat a number of more advanced mathematical topics, with many examples from mechanics and optics. End-of-chapter problems include many that call for use of calculators or computers, and numerous figures help readers visualize uncertainties using error bars."Score a hit! ... the book reveals the exceptional skill of the author as lecturer and teacher. ... a valuable reference work for any student (or instructor) in the sciences and engineering." The Physics Teacher"This is a well written book with good illustrations, index and general bibliography. ... The book is well suited for engineering and science courses at universities and as a basic reference text for those engineers and scientists in practice."
